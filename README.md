ðŸŽ¶ 

We are the lovesick girls  
You canâ€™t just end my love on your own  
We are the lovesick girls  
Without this pain, Iâ€™m nothing at all  

But we were born to be alone  
Yeah, we were born to be alone  
Yeah, we were born to be alone  
But why are we still looking for love?  

No love letters, no X and Oâ€™s  
No love, never â€” my exes know  
No diamond rings, that stuff is set in stone  
To the left, better left alone  

Didnâ€™t wanna be a princess, Iâ€™m priceless  
A prince is not even on my list  
Love is a drug that I quit  
No doctor could help when Iâ€™m lovesick
